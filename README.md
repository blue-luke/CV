## Luke Blackburn

I'm an early career software developer with experience as a science teacher, translator, account executive in HealthTech and Agile project manager. After 6 years working in education, I have changed careers to the tech sector, as it offers future-proof skills, a challenge, and massive scope for growth. I'd love to start my own tech company someday.

## Reviews

Feedback from a recent Coding Review is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x1Z8DeAD3qHvP35FVI2lUdoFvzr_cmJG/view?usp=sharing). Footage is available [here](https://youtu.be/UrAwgF5TE8M). A Coding Review is a live TDD tech test.

## Work Experience

**Self-Employed** (October 2019 to July 2021)  
_Private Residential Tutor_

- I worked in Saudi Arabia and Azerbaijan as a tutor to children in ultra-high net worth families
- I interacted with high-profile parents, and their staff, to achieve high educational standards

**Royal Society of Chemistry** (October 2018 to October 2019)  
_Programme Coordinator_

- I managed two science teacher mentoring projects funded by a high-profile external organisation
- I recruited and managed external consultants, and trained practising teachers to be mentors

**Royal Society of Chemistry** (August 2017 to September 2018)  
_Editorial Assistant_

- I proof-read, copy-edited and commissioned articles for a chemistry education magazine, going to print six times per year, and managed external suppliers

**Avon Valley School and Performing Arts College** (August 2015 to August 2017)  
_Teacher of Science (with Chemistry specialism)_

- I completed my PGCE and NQT at secondary schools in the Midlands, teaching science and chemistry to hundreds of pupils aged from 11 to 16
- I monitored and promoted the general welfare of my students, particularly my form group
- I achieved qualified teacher status in alignment with the Teachers' Standards

**Semos Language Services** (April 2015 to August 2015)  
_Translator_

- Freelance translator and proofreader, Arabic and German to English

**TPP (The Phoenix Partnership)** (February 2014 to April 2015)  
_Account Executive_
- I interacted closely with internal software developers, clinical systems analysts and senior management to align business development with strategic goals and the technical aspects of the system
- I managed 3 contracts (total value ~Â£3.5 million) and interacted with external healthcare stakeholders at all levels
- I pursued international business opportunities in Kazakhstan, China, India and the Emirates

*At the time, TPP had around 175 staff and was still owned and managed by the founder, who largely coded the entire system himself from scratch 15 years prior. I joined when it first started to pursue international opporuntities, branching out from the NHS contracts that had sustained it in the early years. The organisation retained a start-up mentality, with a ptich-in attitude and an open learning & development environment. His vision was 'One Patient, One Record', and I was given a vital insight into how this vision was implemented in the system's architecture and commercially.*

## Skills

#### Ruby/OOP

- My goal was to become familiar with thinking computationally. I taught myself Ruby using online resources, while working full-time as a residential tutor in Azerbaijan, studying daily over an extended period of time to ensure consistent progress. I also completed the GCSE and A-Level computer science syllabi to provide some theoretical underpinning. As a result, I passsed the admissions test for Makers Academy and reached level 4 kyu on Codewars

#### TDD

- I needed to understand and use TDD to complete an arbitrary programming task called FizzBuzz. I worked with a colleague of mine to understand the basic principle and implement it in solving this problem. We progressed carefully, discussing the interpretation and implication of each step, and getting large amounts of practice. As a result, we were able to formulate a large number of tests, use their failure/passing to add additional functionality, drastically reduce the number of errors in the final code, and provide documentation for future users of the codebase

#### Communicating effectively

- I am a clear and concise communicator, able to modify my language depending on the audience. This is a skill I gained from my time as a secondary school chemistry teacher. For example, I once needed to explain an abstract concept (the mole), to a disengaged year 9 class. I used my behaviour management skills to get pupil's attention and emphasised the centrality of this concept to their syllabus, and therefore to their final grades, to motivate them. I introduced it using an example relevant to their experience, using cake baking and the concept of a 'dozen', to help their understanding. As a result, all pupils were able to correctly answer some questions related to the concept at the end of their lesson and in their end of year exams

#### Additional Skills
- German to C1
- Arabic (MSA) to B2

## Education

#### Makers Academy (August - December 2021)
- An intensive, selective bootcamp that trains software developers in 16 weeks
- I learnt several skills and technologies, such as OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD, Agile/XP, Ruby, Rails, Javascript, RSpec and Jasmine
- I also learnt meta-skills such as the ability to learn new tech skills in a short amount of time and how to approach technical problem solving
- Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication

#### Warwick University (2015-2016)

- Post-Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE - Secondary Chemistry)
- Pass

#### Edinburgh University (2010-2012)

- MSc Arab World Studies
- Pass
- I studied colloquial Arabic (Levantine dialect), formal Arabic (MSA) and Middle Eastern Politics

#### Durham University (2007-2010)

- BA Hons, Philosophy, Politics and Economics
- 2:i
- 1/3 of my degree was in economics and featured undergraduate level maths
- Prize for best undergraduate philosophy dissertation

#### Any other qualifications

- AWS Cloud Practitioner
- PRINCE2 Agile Practitioner
- Managing Successful Programmes (MSP) Foundation
- BTEC in Leadership and Management
- Completed the GCSE and A-level computer science syllabi via self-study
- 3 A's at A-level (biology, chemistry, physics)
- 4 A\*s , 5A's, 1B, 2C's at GCSE

## Hobbies

- I write novels and plays in my spare time
